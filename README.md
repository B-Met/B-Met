Team Manager
------------

Hello, I'm Bradley Metcalfe. Currently, I am embarking on an exciting journey towards a BSc (Honours) in Cyber Security through the Open University, a path that marks the beginning of my transition into the world of technology and programming. This journey, which I am one-sixth through, represents not just an academic endeavor but a significant career pivot for me. My professional life has been deeply rooted in sales, where I honed my skills in both B2C and B2B environments. I've led teams of over 30 members, consistently driving them towards excellence in various high-pressure settings. Notably, I co-managed a team of around 80 people for the Conservative Party's campaign during David Cameron's election, a role that involved extensive interaction with constituents to understand and address key local concerns across the United Kingdom. Currently, as a team manager for an inbound sales team of 17 agents, my role encompasses a wide array of responsibilities. I ensure optimal team performance through regular one-on-one meetings, performance improvement plans, appraisals, and daily as well as monthly team meetings. My focus on coaching, development, and mentoring reflects my commitment to not just achieving targets but also fostering professional growth in my team. As I delve deeper into my cybersecurity studies, I am eager to start applying my knowledge through practical projects. This hands-on approach will not only solidify my understanding of the concepts I'm learning but also aid in my transition from a seasoned sales professional to a skilled individual in the tech industry. I am particularly interested in exploring projects that align with my growing skills in programming and cybersecurity, aiming to build a strong foundation in these areas. My journey is one of continuous learning and adaptation. I am excited to bring my extensive experience in team management and strategic planning into the tech domain, blending these skills with my newfound technical knowledge to carve out a unique and impactful career path in cybersecurity and technology.
